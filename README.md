### Analyzing Cloud Vulnerabilities

**Objective:** To perform a security audit of a simulated cloud environment to identify and report on non-compliant configurations and vulnerabilities based on a predefined security policy.

**Tools Used:**
* **ScoutSuite:** An open-source multi-cloud security-auditing tool used to generate a detailed HTML-based report of the cloud infrastructure's security posture.
* **Prowler:** A command-line tool used for auditing cloud security and generating a text-based report to identify security weaknesses and misconfigurations.
* **Virtual Machine (Lab-VM):** The environment used to access and analyze the scan reports.
* **AWS:** The cloud platform (simulated) that was the target of the security scans.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
* **Vulnerability Analysis:** Interpreting and analyzing security reports from industry-standard tools.
* **Policy Compliance Auditing:** Assessing cloud infrastructure against established security policies and best practices.
* **Cloud Security Fundamentals:** Understanding critical cloud security concepts such as IAM, VPCs, network ACLs, and logging (CloudTrail, Flow Logs).
* **Risk Assessment:** Identifying and prioritizing "Danger" and "Warning" level vulnerabilities.
* **Report Interpretation:** Using both graphical (HTML) and text-based security reports to extract key findings.

**Summary of Process:**
1.  **Environment Setup:** Accessed a pre-configured virtual machine containing the results of a vulnerability scan performed with ScoutSuite.
2.  **Report Analysis (ScoutSuite):** Reviewed the HTML-based ScoutSuite report to identify and correlate specific findings with a set of internal security policy requirements.
3.  **Report Analysis (Prowler):** Analyzed a second text-based report generated by Prowler for a simulated acquisition target.
4.  **Reporting:** Formulated a final recommendation based on the combined findings from both reports, demonstrating the ability to synthesize data and provide a professional security assessment.

**Key Takeaways:**
* This lab underscored the critical importance of continuous monitoring and auditing in cloud environments.
* It highlighted that misconfigurations in Identity and Access Management (IAM) and network security groups are among the most common and severe cloud vulnerabilities.
* By using and interpreting reports from tools like ScoutSuite and Prowler, I gained hands-on experience in a core function of a cloud security analyst: proactively identifying and reporting on weaknesses before they can be exploited.
